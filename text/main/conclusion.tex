\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

ML-NIDS systems are the next frontier in NIDS research. Being based on machine learning methods, these systems are capable of learning to distinguish between malicious and benign traffic without the need to manually program them with expert knowledge. These systems do rely on high quality datasets, of which there were numerous attempts to construct and plagued with different issues. 

In this thesis, we have experimentally verified a new method of constructing ML-NIDS datasets through the ConCap framework by reconstructing the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset into ConCap scenarios and showing that the resulting dataset is representative of the original. We find features that hold high predictive power for model training and conclude that ConCap can be used for dataset reconstruction. 

Furthermore, we have further shown that the robustness of ML-NIDS models can be increased by augmenting their training with ConCap traffic, which improves their generalization performance to unseen samples from other datasets. For this, we have generated three variants of attacks already contained in CIC-IDS-2017 and performed adversarial training. Our results show that through adversarial training, ML models can be taught to recognise variants of the attacks without large reductions to their predictive power on the original dataset. 

All of this further cements ConCap (and other such frameworks) as the next step in ML-NIDS dataset generation and augmentation.
