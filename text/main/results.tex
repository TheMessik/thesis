\section{Results}
The processed Netflow files can be found on Kaggle. We perform the verification experiment for each attack class separately. Below we report the results of our experiments. Depending on the traffic the model was trained on, we find different sets of Top 10 features that held most predictive power. We do note that both sets contain common features, and suggest that these features are most representative of the underlying traffic, and consequently should be used as decision features for actual ML-NIDS systems. In tables below, we report these features and the respective ROC AUC scores for models that were trained on CIC traffic (second column) and on ConCap traffic (third column).
