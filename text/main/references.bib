It is based on three basic assumptions: that statistical analysis of computer system and user activities may be used to characterize normal system and user behavior, and that given the resulting statistical profiles, behavior which deviates beyond certain bounds can be detected, that expert system techniques can be applied to security auditing and intrusion detection, and that successful intrusion detection may take place while monitoring a limited set of network activities such as user authentication and access control, file movement and storage, and job scheduling. NADIR has been developed to employ these basic concepts while monitoring the audited activities of more than 8000 ICN users.},

               two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually
               implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly
               mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature
               space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special
               properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization
               ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the
               support-vector network was previously implemented for the
               restricted case where the training data can be separated without
               errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training
               data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks
               utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We
               also compare the performance of the support-vector network to
               various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a
               benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.",

abstract = {A new approach, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, is used to classify program behavior as normal or intrusive. Program behavior, in turn, is represented by frequencies of system calls. Each system call is treated as a word and the collection of system calls over each program execution as a document. These documents are then classified using kNN classifier, a popular method in text categorization. This method seems to offer some computational advantages over those that seek to characterize program behavior with short sequences of system calls and generate individual program profiles. Preliminary experiments with 1998 DARPA BSM audit data show that the kNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate.}

ABSTRACT = {As network attacks are constantly and dramatically evolving, demonstrating new patterns, intelligent Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), using deep-learning techniques, have been actively studied to tackle these problems. Recently, various autoencoders have been used for NIDS in order to accurately and promptly detect unknown types of attacks (i.e., zero-day attacks) and also alleviate the burden of the laborious labeling task. Although the autoencoders are effective in detecting unknown types of attacks, it takes tremendous time and effort to find the optimal model architecture and hyperparameter settings of the autoencoders that result in the best detection performance. This can be an obstacle that hinders practical applications of autoencoder-based NIDS. To address this challenge, we rigorously study autoencoders using the benchmark datasets, NSL-KDD, IoTID20, and N-BaIoT. We evaluate multiple combinations of different model structures and latent sizes, using a simple autoencoder model. The results indicate that the latent size of an autoencoder model can have a significant impact on the IDS performance.},

  abstract  = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) breakthroughs in the last few years
               have accelerated dramatically as a result of the industry's vast
               technological use. Neural Networks (NN) is one of the most vital
               areas of AI, as they allow for commercial use of features that
               were previously not accessible via the use of computers. The
               Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the areas in which
               Neural Networks are being extensively investigated to provide
               comprehensive computer network security and data
               confidentiality. During the realization of this work Artificial
               Neural Network (ANN) were used to shape the proposed model using
               a realistic CICIDS2017 dataset retrieved from the Canadian
               Institute for Cyber-Security (CIC) website. Following
               implementation and testing, it was discovered that the new model
               performs exceptionally well, with an average. In addition, the
               receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) has a 9.999 \% area
               under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (AUC). Finally,
               it was discovered that the new model is exceptional and has a
               high level of accuracy. The new model will aid in an improved
               knowledge of various orders in which IDS research has been
               conducted. It will be useful for those working on AI-based
               solutions in IDS and similar domains. It is possible to enhance
               the new model's detection capabilities to incorporate all other

  abstract  = "In network intrusion detection, anomaly-based approaches in
               particular suffer from accurate evaluation, comparison, and
               deployment which originates from the scarcity of adequate
               datasets. Many such datasets are internal and cannot be shared
               due to privacy issues, others are heavily anonymized and do not
               reflect current trends, or they lack certain statistical
               characteristics. These deficiencies are primarily the reasons
               why a perfect dataset is yet to exist. Thus, researchers must
               resort to datasets that are often suboptimal. As network
               behaviors and patterns change and intrusions evolve, it has very
               much become necessary to move away from static and one-time
               datasets toward more dynamically generated datasets which not
               only reflect the traffic compositions and intrusions of that
               time, but are also modifiable, extensible, and reproducible. In
               this paper, a systematic approach to generate the required
               datasets is introduced to address this need. The underlying
               notion is based on the concept of profiles which contain
               detailed descriptions of intrusions and abstract distribution
               models for applications, protocols, or lower level network
               entities. Real traces are analyzed to create profiles for agents
               that generate real traffic for HTTP, SMTP, SSH, IMAP, POP3, and
               FTP. In this regard, a set of guidelines is established to
               outline valid datasets, which set the basis for generating
               profiles. These guidelines are vital for the effectiveness of
               the dataset in terms of realism, evaluation capabilities, total
               capture, completeness, and malicious activity. The profiles are
               then employed in an experiment to generate the desirable dataset
               in a testbed environment. Various multi-stage attacks scenarios
               were subsequently carried out to supply the anomalous portion of
               the dataset. The intent for this dataset is to assist various
               researchers in acquiring datasets of this kind for testing,
               evaluation, and comparison purposes, through sharing the
               generated datasets and profiles.",

	abstract  = "With the rapid evolution and proliferation of botnets,
	largescale cyber attacks such as DDoS, spam emails are also
	becoming more and more dangerous and serious cyber threats.
	Because of this, network based security technologies such as
	Network based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), Intrusion
	Prevention Systems (IPSs), firewalls have received remarkable
	attention to defend our crucial computer systems, networks and
	sensitive information from attackers on the Internet. In
	particular, there has been much effort towards high-performance
	NIDSs based on data mining and machine learning techniques.
	However, there is a fatal problem in that the existing
	evaluation dataset, called KDD Cup 99' dataset, cannot reflect
	current network situations and the latest attack trends. This is
	because it was generated by simulation over a virtual network
	many years ago. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
	alternative evaluation dataset. In this paper, we present a new
	evaluation dataset, called Kyoto 2006+, built on the 3 years of
	real traffic data (Nov. 2006 ? Aug. 2009) which are obtained
	from diverse types of honeypots. ;",
